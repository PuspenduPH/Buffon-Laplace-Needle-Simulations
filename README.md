# üßÆ Exploring Pi: Buffon's Needle and Buffon-Laplace Simulations

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook and supporting materials for exploring geometric probability through Buffon's Needle Experiment, Buffon-Laplace extensions, and related simulations. By simulating random geometric configurations, we estimate the mathematical constant œÄ, delving into both classical and extended probabilistic frameworks. The repository includes animations, images, a requirements file, and the main notebook, providing a comprehensive resource for understanding and visualizing these experiments.

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Overview

Geometric probability bridges mathematics, probability, and computation, offering a unique approach to estimating constants like $\pi$ through random processes. This repository focuses on:
- **Buffon's Needle Experiment**: Simulating needles dropped onto parallel lines to estimate $\pi$, with variations in needle length and grid configurations.
- **Buffon-Laplace Extension**: Extending the problem to 2D grids (rectangular, triangular, and diamond) for richer probability calculations.
- **Buffon's Noodle Experiment**: Analyzing V- and W-shaped objects dropped onto parallel lines.
- **2D Shapes on Grids**: Investigating squares dropped onto rectangular grids, as detailed in the ["INVESTIGATION ON BUFFON-LAPLACE NEEDLE PROBLEM" (Hang Lung Mathematics Awards, 2021)](https://hlma.hanglung.com/assets/069C8B61-49B2-425D-BCC1-509A324A64AB/17-HM_WYK.pdf).

Through simulations, mathematical derivations, and visualizations, this repository provides both theoretical insights and practical implementations for enthusiasts of probability and computational mathematics.
